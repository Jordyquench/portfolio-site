				<p>The brief was very simple for this assignment, it was to use illustrations and icons that we had previously created to make a travel app with at least three screens. A home screen (with a name for the app), a pick a city screen and a screen with details about the city.</p>

				<p>Page 1 - The first page is a splash screen, gives the user an opportunity to sign into the app. It also has the app icon. It took me a while to come up with an icon and a name for the app. The name I came up with is “away days” this came from the idea that the app is a travel app for football fans wanting to travel to different countries to watch football matches, most likely away matches.</p>

				<p>Page 2 - I have 3 versions of page 2 here, this page is the “pick a city screen” keeping with the simple flat design that I used for the icons in the screens. I tried not to put too much on each of these screens, the motto of each team at the cotton left just fills out the bottom of the page enough without making it too packed in my opinion.</p>

				<p>Page 4 - This screen is the landmark page. It has a cityscape at the top, in the page I designed there is a Madrid cityscape. after that part, it has a list of different attractions and tours you can do while in that city. once you click on the plus it brings up a more detailed section about that particular landmark.</p>
